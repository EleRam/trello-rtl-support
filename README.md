===============

Hi every body :) <br>
After a long time that I disappointed of rtl-support feature on Trello (https://trello.com) I decided to figure out a solution! <br>

So if you are a trello fans and working with RTL language content, I suggest this solution to you. <br>


1. Install this [cjs extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija) for chrome to able run javascript code.
2. Go to [Trello Home Page](https://trello.com)
3. Add content of [script.js](https://github.com/ykh/trello-auto-dir/blob/master/script.js) to cjs extension
4. Enjoyit :)
