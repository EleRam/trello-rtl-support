Trello RTL Support
===============

Hi :) <br>
After a long time that I disappointed of rtl-support feature on [Trello](https://trello.com) I decided to figure a solution out! <br>

So if you are a trello fan and working with it and you have some RTL content in your boards data, I suggest this solution to you. I hope you enjoy it :)<br>

<h2>How to use:</h2>
1. Install [cjs chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija) to run javascript code. (script.js in this case)
2. Go to [Trello Home Page](https://trello.com)
3. Add content of [script.js](https://github.com/ykh/trello-auto-dir/blob/master/script.js) to cjs extension
4. And... Enjoying Trello more than before :)

- [cjs-extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija) is just a tool to run custome javascript in any website you want, so you can use another tool to run the script.js :)<br>
- script.js is written to be use on [Trello](https://trello.com).
- script.js never ever any effects on your trello boards data, it just effect on styles.
